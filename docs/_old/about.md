Hi, I'm Martin.

As CTO at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avrios.com/">Avrios</a> Iâ€™m <span class="highlight">on a mission to build the best engineering teams</span> around the globe. With a person-centered approach, I focus on high-leverage activities to maximize impact, customer value and iteration speed. I'm an <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/martin-buberl/">AWS Hero</a> and a mentor for early-stage Startups at <a target="_blank" href="https://venturecup.dk/">Venture Cup</a>.

In the analog world I enjoy <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/martinbuberl">running</a> and cooking for friends. When I want to get away from it all I love to globe trot, especially when snorkeling or outdoor adventure is involved.
